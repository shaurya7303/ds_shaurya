Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment
Web3 Trading – Data Science Assignment

Objective
This analysis shows us how market sentiment  influences the  trader performances, risk exposure, and behavior using Hyperliquid execution data combined with the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index.
Our  goal is to identify  the behavioral patterns that can support sentiment aware trading strategies.

Data Summary
Trader Data: Trade level executions including trade size, direction, timestamp, and realized PnL.
Sentiment Data: Daily Bitcoin Fear & Greed classification.
Trades were matched to sentiment regimes using the trade date.

Methodology
Parsed and aligned timestamps
Merged trades with daily sentiment labels
Engineered performance and risk metrics:
Profitability
Win rate
Trade size 
Conducted sentiment-level and trader-level analysis
Visualized PnL and risk distributions

Key Findings
Trader behavior changes significantly across sentiment regimes
Greed regimes show:
Larger trade sizes
Higher PnL volatility
Fear regimes show:
Reduced exposure
More stable outcomes

Consistently profitable traders scale down risk during sentiment extremes
Sell-side trades during Fear often outperform, indicating contrarian behavior

Strategic Implications
Market sentiment functions as a risk regime indicator
Exposure controls should tighten during Greed
Trader evaluation should include performance under Fear
Sentiment-aware position sizing can improve consistency

Limitations
Sentiment is measured at daily granularity
Psychological intent inferred from behavior
Does not include volatility or funding rate data

Conclusion
Market sentiment materially impacts trader behavior and outcomes.
Traders who adapt risk dynamically across sentiment regimes outperform those who react emotionally.
Sentiment is not a price signal — it is a behavioral risk signal.
